/*
    This is a classic Dynamic Programming problem.

    Let dp[i] is the minimum cost to reach to i_th floor.
    
    To reach to i_th floor, we have 2 ways:
        Jump 1 step from (i-1)th floor, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + cost[i-1]
        Jump 2 steps from (i-2)th floor, dp[i] = dp[i-2] + cost[i-2]
        dp[i] = minimum cost between 2 above ways.
        Finally, dp[n] is minimum cost to reach to the top of the floor.
